/**
 * This rep's month, in one pass over the doctor list they already have cached —
 * so it costs no extra request, works offline, and reports the same numbers the
 * Call Reporting list shows.
 *
 * CALLS: the plan is the sum of each doctor's class quota — an A4 doctor is 4
 * calls, an A2 is 2 — which the backend resolves per doctor↔rep from
 * doctor_tso_class_monthly_visit (falling back to the class master) and returns
 * as `MaxVisitCount`. `VisitCount` is the completed calls against that quota.
 * Doctors with no class carry no quota, so they count toward NEITHER side —
 * including their calls in "made" would push the figure past a plan that never
 * asked for them.
 *
 * COVERAGE: a doctor is covered once the rep has called on them AT ALL this
 * month — one call is enough, whatever their class. So an A4 doctor at 1 of 4
 * calls is fully covered but only a quarter of the way through their quota,
 * which is why the two figures move independently. Every assigned doctor counts
 * toward the total here, classified or not.
